## About Klamm

Klamm is intended to be a data-capture tool for use by Sector Priorities, it should:

- Allow the Forms Modernization team to inventory its forms and what data they container.
- Allow the Business Rules Engine team to contribute their discoveries of data sources.
- Allow the FODIG teams to track their data-repository discoveries.

Klamm is built using [FilamentPHP][https://filamentphp.com] which is itself built atop [Laravel][https://laravel.com].

It also uses Blueprint to speed up the generation of model boilerplate. 

## Caution regarding auto-generated content.

The models, factories and migrations are all automatically generated by Blueprint using the draft.yml file as the basis. These files are liable to be clobbered when anything is rebuilt using Blueprint.

Also, when generating these files - be sure to execute the blueprint:erase command immeditely preceding the blueprint:build command to ensure duplicates are not generated - this is especially annoying for migrations.
