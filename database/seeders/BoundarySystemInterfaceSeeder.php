Additional Information:
JV\'s for payments issued in MIS are created on the mainframe and sent to CAS using SFTP.
The JV\'s are sent in separate jobs, but all the feedback files are picked up in one job:
HADAJPHE -formats the JV\'s to be sent to CAS for the computer cheques just issued. 
HADAJPHF - formats the JV\'s to be sent to CAS for monthly computer cheque  reversals for the current fiscal year.  
HADAJPHR - formats the JV\'s to be sent to CAS for monthly EFT reversals for the current fiscal year.
HADAJPHT - formats the JV\'s to be sent to CAS for monthly EFT\'s just created. 
These jobs get are run on the first workday after cheque run on request - they have to be sent to CAS before the CAS cut off which I believe is late afternoon. However looking at historical the jobs, they usually run around lunchtime. 

HADAJPHG - format the JV\'s to be sent to CAS for the monthly computer cheque reversals for the  prior fiscal year.    
HADAJPHS - formats the JV\'s to be sent to CAS for monthly computer cheque  reversals for the previous fiscal year. 
For these two prior year reversal jobs, the scheduling is dependent on the results from the GL report created by job HMISJPHF (run in May-Mar).  In April job HMISJPHF is split into 3 jobs with job HMIS02HF producing the GL report at April monthend.

The following Wednesday  job HADAJPH4  is run to pick up the feedback reports for all the JV\'s sent earlier in the week. The feeback reports are pickedup using SFTP and then the reports are sent to office 013 inR2W (FASB)',

The new client identity is sent to the EMPI as a downstream (or batch) process. Sometimes known as front-end integration or active search.
