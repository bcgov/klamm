BCCCU reports come directly from Central 1 when the daily files are downloaded so we have no insight into the logic. There are similar reports for OD cheques that are also sent to R2W.
HMISJPJK carries out bank reconciliation processing and uses the DREC file to match cheque data from Central 1 to the MIS payment history DB2 tables and updates cashed cheque data.
Mismatched records are reported in report MI92T-01. which is also produced by job JPJK.

FASB Banking,BCCCU Account Activity And Balances (AMP),"Central 1 activity and balances
BCCCU reports come directly from Central 1 when the daily files are downloaded so we have no insight into the logic. There are similar reports for OD cheques that are also sent to R2W.
HMISJPJK carries out bank reconciliation processing and uses the DREC file to match cheque data from Central 1 to the MIS payment history DB2 tables and updates cashed cheque data.
Mismatched records are reported in report MI92T-01. which is also produced by job JPJK. 
A discovery session with FASB and possibly Treasury would be required to provide more details on the logic
